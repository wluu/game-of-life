# TODOs

Going to break this down into smaller chunks:

- [x] Make the board
  - [x] Forgot to add the borders to the board
- [x] Add event listeners to each cell in the board
  - Change color of any given cell when clicking on them
- [ ] Work on game of life rules
  - Flesh this part out when deep in it; will need to hook up the rules to the board
- [ ] Add the controls
  - Start with text to substitute for the image of each control
  - Flesh this part as well when deep in it; will need to hook this part to the rules and the board
